        <h4>Administrator - The Richard Alston Dance Company</h4>
            <p>
                Being organsied, efficient and remaining calm under pressure are just a few of my skills that 
                enable me to be an effective memeber of the Richard Alston Dance Company Team. As the company has 
                an incredibly busy touring schedule I must manage my time effectily when managing the 
                travel and accommodation logistics of the entire company (currently 17 people). On a daily basis
                I manage mulitple budgets, create schedules, liaise with venues both nationally and internationally, 
                process invoices and lead on the various visa applicaiton process for international performances.

        <h4>Administrator - EDGE Dance Company</h4>
            <p>
                EDGE Dance Company featured post-graduate students, all of whom had never toured a dance show. I was responsibile
                managing the tour schedule for the company, talking to venues to book the company and negotiating a good 
                deal for the company.
